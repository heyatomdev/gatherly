 * never reaches one — and those are exactly the statuses the alerts are for.
 * The `finish` event fires for every response, whatever produced it, and by
 * then Express has set `req.route` for any request that matched a route,
 * guards included. The label is that route pattern (`/events/:id`), never the
 * raw URL, which carries ids and would blow up cardinality.
